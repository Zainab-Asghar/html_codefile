This repository showcases a collection of clean, minimal, and responsive UI components built using pure HTML and CSS. 
Each mini project focuses on layout design, visual hierarchy, and modern styling techniques without relying on JavaScript. 
The purpose of this repository is to strengthen front-end fundamentals and demonstrate an eye for simplicity, structure,
and user-focused design through small but polished interface implementations.
